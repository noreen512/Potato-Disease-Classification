Project Description:
This project focuses on classifying potato leaf diseases using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of healthy and diseased potato leaves. The goal is to develop an image classification system that can help farmers and agricultural experts detect potato diseases early.

üöÄ Features
Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning.
Processes images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Uses Matplotlib for visualization.
Handles dataset processing and augmentation.
Trains the model on a labeled dataset to classify different potato diseases.

It contains images categorized into:

Healthy Potato Leaves
Early Blight
Late Blight
